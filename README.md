## ***microPy-IDE***

The *microPy-IDE* is a development environment for the [microPython language](https://micropython.org/) which is a subset of Python 3 and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained environments. 



*microPy* runs on a host PC and connects to a target device (QDEV board) via a serial port. The target device must be running the correct version of the microPython interpreter for the targets specific microcontroller, see [microPython download](https://micropython.org/download/).

*microPy* allows the user to create, test, and deploy microPython scripts. *microPy* incorporates a full featured editor with syntax highlighting,
